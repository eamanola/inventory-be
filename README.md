# inventory-be

A small full stack demo, showing some 3rd party api data.

Using some node scripts to bypass cors and format the data. Also am in-memory cache implemented.

Front-end done with react. Front end code in the submodule.

Live demo at https://inventory-fs.herokuapp.com/

Expect some timeouts, in the live demo, and page refreshes =). Every timeout manages to fill some of the necessary cache, and one or two refreshes should be enough to get the app started :D
