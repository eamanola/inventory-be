# inventory-be

A small full stack demo, showing some 3rd party api data.

Using some node scripts to bypass cors and format the data. Also an in-memory cache implemented.

Front-end done with react. Front end code in the submodule.

Live demo at https://inventory-fs.herokuapp.com/

The 3rd party api has a random error generator built in. If you see the message "manufacturer X could not be reached", fix it with good old refresh.
